# Radioactive-Dice
An attempt at a true random dice roller using arduino and sensors detecting alpha decay from americium found in standard smoke detectors


# The Reason
There isn't really a fantastic reason for this project. The goal of this project was more an effort in discovery and exploring the concept of true random events in nature and trying to then make a dice roller that works with them.
